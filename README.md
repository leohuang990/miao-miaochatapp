Acknowledgement:
The idea of this chat app is strongly motivated by Mr. Trump's efforts to block WeChat in America. To people who have been using WeChat for so many years, it would be a real disaster so I try to build up a similar app. This project eventually takes me a whole winter break.


Most functionalities as well as icon was inspired by WeChat of Tencent and those wonderful background images come from a similarly wonderful website Pexels.
